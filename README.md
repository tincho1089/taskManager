### Local execution with Docker
 The command will build the frontend project developed in React JS with Vite.
`docker-compose stop && docker-compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`

This is the final result of the services that you should see if everything works as expected.

### Testing
To execute the tests locally, we need to install the libraries dependencies for the service with `npm i`. After that we can run the command:
`npm run test`

The tests are working with Vitest and Testing Library
